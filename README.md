## Push API demo on App Engine

A demo App Engine server using https://w3c.github.io/push-api/ to send push
messages to web browsers.

Live version: https://johnme-gcm.appspot.com/chat/

Currently requires Chrome 42+. Other browsers will be added as they implement
the Push and Notifications APIs (Firefox Nightly already has partial support).

See [requirements.txt][1] for instructions on installing dependencies, if you
want to run your own copy on App Engine.
